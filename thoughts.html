            <h3>Graduating...a bootcamp!</h3>
            <p>Starting my coding bootcamp was both exciting and intimidating. At first, the flood of new information felt overwhelming, but I quickly learned that consistency and asking for help made all the difference. Each project pushed me to grow not only my technical skills but also my problem-solving and teamwork abilities. Though there were tough days and late nights, the support from instructors and peers kept me motivated. Graduating from the bootcamp feels like a huge milestone, and I’m excited to continue building on what I’ve learned as I embark on my journey in tech.</p>
