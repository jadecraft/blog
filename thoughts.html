            <h3>Moving to New York</h3>
            <p>Moving across the country is never easy, but sometimes life gives you a reason that makes the leap worth it. For me, that reason was love. I packed up my life in Kansas and made the move to New York to live with my girlfriend, and it’s been one of the biggest, most exciting changes I’ve ever made.
            Growing up in Kansas, I was used to wide open spaces, quieter towns, and a slower pace of life. It’s what I knew, familiar, comfortable, and predictable. But as my relationship grew stronger, the idea of closing the distance and building something new together started to feel not just possible, but necessary.
            The decision wasn’t one I took lightly. Leaving behind family, friends, and everything familiar was tough. I had to weigh the comfort of what I knew against the possibilities of a future built alongside someone I care deeply about. In the end, the chance to grow, experience new things, and share daily life with my girlfriend felt worth the risk.
            New York is everything Kansas isn’t. It’s fast, loud, and full of energy. At first, it was overwhelming. But I’m learning to embrace it. I’m discovering new favorite spots, figuring out the streets, and adjusting to apartment living after having so much more space back home.
            What’s made this transition easier is having my girlfriend by my side. Sharing this new chapter together has been exciting and has helped me feel grounded even in unfamiliar surroundings. Every day feels like we’re building something together, and that makes all the challenges feel worth it.
            Moving from Kansas to New York has taught me that growth often comes when you step outside your comfort zone. It’s not always easy, but it opens the door to new experiences, stronger relationships, and unexpected joys.</p>

            <h3>Finding a Job</h3>
            <p>After graduating my bootcamp I have been putting more focus into my degree and I am in high hopes of taking an additional course each term to finish my degree earlier. The job market is hard currently- many companies portraying they are hiring, but not and the many rejection letters I keep receiving. Although it is frustrating and discouraging at times, I persist. I am very excited to continuously grow in my feild and I look forward to the oppurtunities that I will take on in the future.  </p>

            <h3>Graduating...a bootcamp!</h3>
            <p>Starting my coding bootcamp was both exciting and intimidating. At first, the flood of new information felt overwhelming, but I quickly learned that consistency and asking for help made all the difference. Each project pushed me to grow not only my technical skills but also my problem-solving and teamwork abilities. Though there were tough days and late nights, the support from instructors and peers kept me motivated. Graduating from the bootcamp feels like a huge milestone, and I’m excited to continue building on what I’ve learned as I embark on my journey in tech.</p>
